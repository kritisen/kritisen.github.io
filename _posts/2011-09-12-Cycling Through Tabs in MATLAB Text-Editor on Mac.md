## Cycling Through Tabs in MATLAB Text-Editor on Mac

Have a lot of .m files opened in your MATLAB Editor, and need to cycle through them quickly using your keyboard?

The keyboard shortcut to do this on Windows is

**CTRL + Pg-Up/Pg-Down**

If your Mac keyboard, has **Pg-Up/Pg-Down**, then you are in luck and you can use the above combination.

Otherwise, use:

**CTRL + fn + Up-Arrow / Dn-Arrow**
