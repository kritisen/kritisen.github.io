Presented at: _Annual Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society_, Hartford, CT, Oct. 2011

## Abstract

Traditional imaging methods such as SEM, TEM provide extensive information at the surface but no internal 3D structures. On the other hand, traditional micro-CT (computed tomography) allows 3D non-destructive imaging but its resolution was limited to 20µm. Thus many biologically relevant features could not be resolved. More recently, we have enhanced protocols for use with higher resolution CT-imaging systems capable of imaging at multiple scales/resolutions (16µm to 65nm). In this study, we report our progress in imaging samples of biomedical/biological relevance using multi-scale CT systems.
