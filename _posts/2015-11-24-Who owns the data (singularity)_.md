## Who owns the data (singularity)?

Interested to know what folks more knowledgeable about bio think about this:  
[http://www.fiercebigdata.com/story/new-aws-public-data-sets-and-rise-data-singularity/2015-11-23](http://www.fiercebigdata.com/story/new-aws-public-data-sets-and-rise-data-singularity/2015-11-23)

AWS is providing access to TCGA (the cancer genome atlas) for free. Does this undermine / strengthen our work on TCGA and the SciDB backed 1000-genome project? Especially in reference to this sentence:

> "... the formation of massive datasets is in our near future until eventually we will reach a point where conceivably there is only one dataset that can be mined for anything and everything: A data singularity."

And the fact that this data singularity is associated with Amazon.
