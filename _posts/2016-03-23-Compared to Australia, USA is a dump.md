## Compared to Australia, USA is a dump

Heard these very interesting comments about US infrastructure on National Public Radio today:

> I traveled from Boston to LAX and then to Sydney. I also happened to travel a fair bit around Australia in that trip. Compared to Australia, and in general to most of Europe, USA is a dump.

> It's not that US does not have the money. We have the money. But any project, even the most obvious ones, takes 10 years to get the green-signal. There is just too much red-tape. In Germany, it takes 2 years.

I have stayed in USA for eight years now. There are obvious advantages of living here. But there are many disadvantages too -- one of them being a very poor public transport infrastructure. These comments explain a lot to me.
