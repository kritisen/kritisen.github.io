## Lessons from startup founders

Yesterday, my company [Paradigm4](http://paradigm4.com) was featured under the NewSQL banner in Matt Turck's blog post about [the big-data landscape in 2016](http://mattturck.com/2016/02/01/big-data-landscape/).

I was digging around on his company site and found a nice piece by one of their younger folk -- summarizing comments by many CEO-s, startup founders who have spoken at their company's events. Found it quite interesting: read [it here](https://medium.com/@andrewoved/insights-from-two-years-of-driven-founders-715e10af2461#.cqmrlmbzm).

Some were directly relevant to the field of databases -- e.g. the CAP theorem is directly quoted in one of the comments. Some of the comments I found interesting:

-   **Try to rid of internal emails completely because they get in the way of productivity**. Instead, all members of the product and design teams should use Slack + GitHub + Sunrise + any other tools to keep your team out of their inbox. [[Jeremy Le Van](https://twitter.com/jeremylv), Sunrise]

-   **Data prep is still the primary time-suck** for data science teams. [[Amir Orad](https://twitter.com/AmirOrad), Sisense]

-   **The Minimum Viable Product should not just be your first release — it should be every release.** [[Rohun Gholkar](https://twitter.com/rohun), NewsCred]

Matt Turck's claim to fame: He / his company is VC to airbnb, DraftKings, pinterest, lumosity and [others](http://firstmarkcap.com/portfolio/).
