> Citus is a distributed database that scales across commodity servers using transparent sharding and replication. Citus extends the underlying database rather than forking it, giving developers and enterprises the power and familiarity of a relational database. As an extension, Citus supports new PostgreSQL releases, and allows you to benefit from new features while maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools.

> Citus Cloud helps when you have a need to scale your database beyond a single node, often beginning as early as 10 GBs of dataâ€”and allowing you to scale to 100s of Terabytes.
