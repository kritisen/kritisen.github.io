title: A typical data science workflow
---

Michael Stonebraker, Samuel Madden and Timothy Mattson wrote [an article](http://istc-bigdata.org/index.php/the-big-data-istc-a-retrospection-by-michael-stonebraker-samuel-madden-and-timothy-mattson/) covering the achievements of the ISTC big-data group at MIT in the last five years. Our company's database [SciDB](http://paradigm4.com) originated from this project, and is listed as one of the major achievements of the group. 

Separately, I found the following very interesting quote describing a typical data-science application workflow:

> Data science applications revolve around the following paradigm:

```sh
Until (tired) {
  Data management
  Complex analytics
}
```
