I work at the intersection of software (programming, distributed computing, analytics, ML/AI) and life sciences (pharma R&D, genomics, bioinformatics, medical imaging). More details are available at [my LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/kritisen).

In 2021, I self-published a book -- [The Creative Side Hustle: Five steps to launch your creative career (while keeping your day job)](http://mybook.to/creativesidehustle). 

I also blog about various topics under the sun at this blog.
